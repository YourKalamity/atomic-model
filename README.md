This webpage was the first time I opted for a mobile-first development approach, which made making it look good on all devices much easier than other webpages I have worked on. The goal was to ensure that no matter the device, the content would be easy to read, look fairly modern and be informational.

This project utilises
- W3.CSS framework
- The "Dosis" font from Google 
- Photographs from various sources on the web

In the future, I will not be using W3.CSS since it did not provide much real value to me other than being able to center items faster.
